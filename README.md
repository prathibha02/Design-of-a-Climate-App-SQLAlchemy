Using Python and SQLAlchemy to perform basic climate analysis and data exploration of a climate database
#### Precipitation Analysis

To perform an analysis of precipitation in the area, we do the following:

* Find the most recent date in the dataset.

* Using this date, retrieve the previous 12 months of precipitation data by querying the 12 previous months of data.

* Select only the `date` and `prcp` values.

* Load the query results into a Pandas DataFrame, and set the index to the date column.

* Sort the DataFrame values by `date`.

* Plot the results by using the DataFrame `plot` method

* Use Pandas to print the summary statistics for the precipitation data.

#### Station Analysis

To perform an analysis of stations in the area, we do the following:

* Design a query to calculate the total number of stations in the dataset.

* Design a query to find the most active stations (the stations with the most rows).

    * List the stations and observation counts in descending order.

    * Which station id has the highest number of observations?

    * Using the most active station id, calculate the lowest, highest, and average temperatures.


* Design a query to retrieve the previous 12 months of temperature observation data (TOBS).

    * Filter by the station with the highest number of observations.

    * Query the previous 12 months of temperature observation data for this station.

    * Plot the results as a histogram with `bins=12`

### Part 2: Design Of Climate App

Now that we have completed our initial analysis, we design a Flask API based on the queries that we have just developed.

Use Flask to create our routes, as follows:

* `/`

    * Homepage.

    * List all available routes.

* `/api/v1.0/precipitation`

    * Convert the query results to a dictionary using `date` as the key and `prcp` as the value.

    * Return the JSON representation of your dictionary.

* `/api/v1.0/stations`

    * Return a JSON list of stations from the dataset.

* `/api/v1.0/tobs`

    * Query the dates and temperature observations of the most active station for the previous year of data.

    * Return a JSON list of temperature observations (TOBS) for the previous year.

* `/api/v1.0/<start>` and `/api/v1.0/<start>/<end>`

    * Return a JSON list of the minimum temperature, the average temperature, and the maximum temperature for a given start or start-end range.

    * When given the start only, calculate `TMIN`, `TAVG`, and `TMAX` for all dates greater than or equal to the start date.

    * When given the start and the end date, calculate the `TMIN`, `TAVG`, and `TMAX` for dates from the start date through the end date (inclusive).
